												<p>SIn wireless communications, the pathloss (or large scale fading coefficient) quantifies the loss
of signal strength between a transmitter (Tx) and a receiver (Rx) due to large scale effects, such as
free-space propagation loss, and interactions of the radio waves with the objects and structures in the propagation environment, such as penetration, reflection and diffraction.
Many present or envisioned applications in wireless communications explicitly rely on the
knowledge of the pathloss function, and thus, estimating pathloss is a crucial task. Some
example use cases include: User-cell site association, fingerprint-based localization, physical-
layer security, optimal power control, path planning, and activity detection.
Deterministic simulation methods such as ray-tracing are well-known to provide very good
estimations of pathloss values. However, their high computational complexity renders them
unsuitable for most of the envisioned applications.
In the very recent years, many research groups have developed deep learning-based methods
which achieve a comparable accuracy with respect to ray-tracing, but with orders of magnitude
lower computational times, making accurate pathloss estimations available for the applications.
In order to foster research and facilitate fair comparisons among the methods, we provide a
novel pathloss radio map dataset based on ray-tracing simulations and launch the First Pathloss
Radio Map Prediction Challenge.
In addition to the pathloss prediction task, the challenge also includes coverage classification
as a second independent task, where the locations in a city map should be classified to be above
or below a given pathloss value.
Support on the dataset and the instructions will be provided by the organizing team.</p>

<!-- <p>Wireless signal propagation simulations can furnish estimates of large or small-scale fading, employed to estimate the user equipment (UE) received signal strength and consequently streamline 
	various wireless network simulations. A widely adopted measure for quantifying large-scale fading is <em><b>pathloss (PL)</em></b> , which indicates the power attenuation of the emitted signals, due to free-space losses
	or because of the electromagnetic wave interaction with obstacles in the propagation environment, e.g. reflection,  refraction, or diffraction. Indicatively, applications relying on wireless signal PL include: 

	<em><b>coverage prediction, user-cell site association, fingerprint-based localization, physical-layer security,  power control, network planning, link scheduling, and activity recognition.
</em></b>

To evaluate PL or other wireless channel characteristics one can use radio propagation models. Existing channel modeling techniques exhibit a notorious trade-off: 
						    deterministic models, e.g. ray tracing, are highly accurate, yet computationally demanding, while the opposite holds for 
						    empirical and stochastic models.  Recently, substantial effort has been made to develop data-driven methods, which can 
						    be trained to yield commensurate accuracy with deterministic propagation models, accompanied by impressive computational 
						    efficiency due to the native graph processing unit (GPU) parallelization of deep neural networks. However, while previous
						    research has focused mostly on deep learning (DL)-based PL inference for outdoor urban environments and isotropic transmission, 
						    due to the wide deployment of indoor wireless networks in fifth-generation and beyond (5G/B5G) networks, it's necessary to develop
						    models tailored for indoor environments. In such cases, the refracted electromagnetic field components through obstacles play a more
						    significant role in radio signal propagation, as opposed to the outdoor scenarios that is dominated by reflected field components.
						    Therefore, accurate indoor radio map estimation requires accounting for the larger variety of construction materials and their 
						    electromagnetic properties. Similarly, the antenna radiation pattern of the transmitters needs to be appropriately considered.
                                                </p>
