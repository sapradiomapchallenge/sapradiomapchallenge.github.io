<p>In wireless communications, the <b><em>path loss (PL)</em></b>, also known as the <em>large-scale fading coefficient</em>, quantifies signal
strength attenuation between a transmitter (Tx) and a receiver (Rx) due to large-scale effects, such as free-space
propagation loss, and interactions such as penetration, reflection, and diffraction, of radio waves with the objects
and structures in the propagation environment. Many existing or emerging applications in wireless communications
explicitly rely on knowledge of the spatial distribution of the PL, so it is paramount to have reliable estimates of it.
Some indicative use cases include: User-cell site association, network deployment, fingerprint-based localization,
physical-layer security, optimal power control, path planning, and activity detection.</p>


<p>To evaluate PL or other wireless channel characteristics one can use radio propagation models. Existing channel
modeling techniques exhibit a notorious trade-off: deterministic models, e.g., ray tracing, are highly accurate, yet
computationally demanding, while the opposite holds for empirical and stochastic models. Recently, substantial
effort has been made to develop data-driven methods, which can be trained to yield commensurate accuracy with
deterministic propagation models, accompanied by impressive computational efficiency due to the native graph
processing unit (GPU) parallelization of deep neural networks. However, while previous research has focused
mostly on deep learning (DL)-based PL inference for outdoor urban environments, due to the wide deployment
of indoor wireless networks in fifth-generation and beyond (5G/B5G) networks, it is necessary to develop models
tailored for indoor environments. In such cases, the refracted electromagnetic field components through obstacles
play a more significant role in radio signal propagation, as opposed to the outdoor scenarios that are dominated
by reflected field components. Therefore, accurate indoor radio map estimation requires accounting for the greater
variety of construction materials and their electromagnetic properties.
</p>

 <p>									
To advocate further research in this direction and facilitate fair comparisons in the development of DL-based
radio propagation models in the less explored case of PL radio maps in indoor environments, and motivated by the
success of the <strong><a href="https://radiomapchallenge.github.io/"><font color="blue">First Pathloss 
Radio Map Prediction Challenge at ICASSP 2023</font></a></strong> and the <strong><a href="https://indoorradiomapchallenge.github.io/"><font color="blue">First Indoor Pathloss 
Radio Map Prediction Challenge at ICASSP 2025</font></a></strong>, we share an indoor PL radio map dataset generated through ray tracing
simulations, launching the <b>Sampling-Assisted Pathloss Radio Map Prediction Data Competition at MLSP 2025</b>. The challenge consists of
<b>two tasks that explore the prediction of PL radio maps using DL-based methods when aided by ground truth PL
samples with varying sampling rates</b> from the propagation environment. <b>The first task</b> considers a uniform random
selection of sampling locations, while <b>the second task</b> focuses on investigating the impact of PL sampling location
selection, thus requiring the exploration of efficient and effective sampling techniques to improve the fidelity of
radio map estimation over random sampling.
